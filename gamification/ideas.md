# Ideas for Gamification

Goal is to motivate the user to change their behavior. In principle we need to separate the cases of the injured patient who is working his or her way back to health and the user who seeks to prevent an injury from occuring in the first place. The reasons for separating has to do with group dynamics. We do not want to reward a group for having more injuries than other groups.

## Preventative
Form teams of employees, either in different groups or departments or companies. Reward the group for completing all the required exercises as a whole. Counting steps for the team would reward the larger team. Instead, what percentage of team members completed the daily requirement of exercises. This eliminates the advantage a larger team would have.

In the end different teams have a score than can be compared with each other. Choose a winner of the month, then reset and start again.

## Individuals
For individuals we want to track the progress the patient has made in the module planned by the therapist. The tool should track if the patient clicked through all the activities assigned to the patient by the therapist. There should be no bonus but rather a penalty for doing more than prescribed. We do not want the patient to overdo it and injure themselves.

### Weg zur Gesundheit
Imagine a race track or a path the patient has to go to reach the finish: Weg zur Gesundheit. For each successful completion of a Tagesplan, the patient advances on the track. Dynamically assign reward points for percentage of completion. For a track with 20 fields, maybe a reward at 25, 50, and 75 percent. For a track with 4 fields a larger reward at 50 percent.

### Bausteine eine gesunde Körper
Imagine Lego bricks. For each completed Tagesplan or set of Tagespläne, you get a brick which you can use to complete your healthy body. A similar idea would be to allow the patient to build something creatively and not have a fixed picture that the patient completes. This gives the patient a little room to play.

## Rewards
* Rebate a percentage of the fee the patient paid for the application
* A reward from the Krankenkasse in either cash, goods, or services.
* Offer new exercises or updated exercises with consultation with the therapist.
* Trophies or pictures to collect. 
* Time off, cash, goods, or services from the employer.
* Chances to win prizes in some kind of lottery

## Feedback
From time to time, ask the patient how they are feeling. Perhaps ask them how they feel on a scale of 1-10. This feedback can fulfill two purposes:
1. The therapist gets a feedback on how the patient is doing. If there are too many negative feedbacks, the therapist could actively contact the patient to see what is going wrong.
2. We could present the patient with a graphic depiction of how they are feeling over time. Hopefully the patient will see that they are improving.
